<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  The mission of the <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>
  project is to help researchers be more productive by teaching them basic
  computing skills. Researchers often spend much of their time wrestling
  with software, but most are self-taught programmers. As a result, they
  spend hours doing things that should take minutes, reinvent a lot of
  wheels, and still don't know if their results are reliable. To tackle
  this problem, Software Carpentry runs two-day workshops at
  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/previous.html">hundreds
  of sites around the world</a>. These hands-on workshops cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation. Participants are be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.
</p>

<!--

<h2 id="setup">Workshop Setup</h2>
<h3>Create a GitHub account</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is an online hosting service for all your code.
  We'll be using it in the lesson on version control,
  and GitHub credentials are used for login authentication on DIT4C.
  GitHub accounts are free, so sign up for one if you don't already have an account.
</p>
<h3>Create a DIT4C Account</h3>
<p>
  During the first session of the workshop, the instructors will give you the
  compute node name and access code you'll need for the Data Intensive Tools for
  the Cloud (DIT4C) environment that is hosted on the NeCTAR Research Cloud. Once you've
  got that name and code, navigate to the
  <a href="http://resbaz.cloud.edu.au/ ">DIT4C homepage</a> and follow these instructions:
  <ol>
    <li>Click the "login" button and proceed to login using your GitHub credentials.</li>
    <li>Go to the "compute nodes" tab and click "claim compute node access".</li>
    <li>From the drop down menu, select the name of the compute node that the instructor
    gave you and enter the corresponding access code.</li>
    <li>Go to the "containers" tab and add a new container named after yourself
    (e.g. johnsmith). The reason for this is that container names are unique (i.e. you can't
    have the same container name as anyone else in the room). Select an "IPython" image
    from the drop down menu and then hit the create button.</li>
    <li>When the container is "on", its name should turn blue and you can click on it to
    launch your environment in a new tab of your browser.</li>
    <li>Once you're finished for the day, simply close all the extra tabs that have opened up
    and turn your container "off". When you come back tomorrow, simply switch back to the 'on'
    position to continue using that container.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h2 id="software_install">Software Installation (not required)</h2>
<p>
  The DIT4C environment comes with all the required software pre-installed, 
  however if you would like to install the software on your own computer 
  (either before or after the workshop),
  here are the instructions to do so.
</p>
<div> <!-- Start of 'editor' section. -->
<h4>Text Editor</h4>
<p>
  When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
  optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
  color-coding of key words. The default text editor on Mac OS X and
  Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
  intuitive. if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
  typing the escape key, followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q',
  exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.
</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>Windows</h5>
<p>
<code>nano</code> is the editor installed by the Software
Carpentry Installer, it is a basic editor integrated into the
lesson material.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a
popular free code editor for Windows. Be aware that you must
add its installation directory to your system path in order to
launch it from the command line (or have other tools like Git
launch it for you). Please ask your instructor to help you do
this.
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>Mac OS X</h5>
<p>
We recommend
<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a> or
<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
which should be pre-installed.
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>Linux</h5>
<p>
<a href="http://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a> is one option for
Linux users. In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>, which
should be pre-installed.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div> <!-- End of 'editor' section. -->
<div> <!-- Start of 'shell' section. -->
<h4>The Bash Shell</h4>
<p>
Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
tasks more quickly.
</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>Windows</h5>
<p>
Install Git for Windows by download and running
<a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">the installer</a>.
This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
</p>
<h5>Software Carpentry Installer</h5>
<p><em>This installer requires an active internet connection.</em></p>
<p>After installing Python and Git Bash:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Download the <a href="{{site.swc_installer}}">installer</a>.
</li>
<li>
If the file opens directly in the browser
select <strong>File&rarr;Save Page As</strong> to download it
to your computer.
</li>
<li>
Double click on the file to run it.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>Mac OS X</h5>
<p>
The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash, so no
need to install anything. You access bash from the Terminal
(found in
<code>/Applications/Utilities</code>). You may want to keep
Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>Linux</h5>
<p>
The default shell is usually <code>bash</code>, but if your
machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
terminal and typing <code>bash</code>. There is no need to
install anything.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div> <!-- End of 'shell' section. -->
<div> <!-- Start of 'Git' section. -->
<h4>Git</h4>
<p>
Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
version of your code
on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>Windows</h5>
<p>
Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
install (described above).
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>Mac OS X</h5>
<p>
<strong>For OS X 10.8 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
by downloading and running
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/latest/download">the installer</a>.
After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
as Git is a command line program.
<strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.7)</strong> use the
most recent available installer for your
OS <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available
here</a>. Use the Leopard installer for 10.5 and the Snow
Leopard installer for 10.6-10.7.
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>Linux</h5>
<p>
If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
<code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
<code>sudo yum install git</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div> <!-- End of 'Git' section. -->
<div> <!-- Start of 'Python' section. -->
<h4>Python</h4>
<p>
<a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
well. Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
a bit difficult, so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>Windows</h5>
<ul>
<li>
Download and
install <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>.
</li>
<li>
Use all of the defaults for installation
<em>except</em> make sure to check <strong>Make Anaconda the
default Python</strong>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>Mac OS X</h5>
<ul>
<li>
Download and
install <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>.
</li>
<li>
Use all of the defaults for installation
<em>except</em>
make sure to check <strong>Make Anaconda the default Python</strong>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>Linux</h5>
<p>
We recommend the all-in-one scientific Python installer
<a href="http://continuum.io/downloads.html">Anaconda</a>.
(Installation requires using the shell and if you aren't
comfortable doing the installation yourself just
download the installer and we'll help you at the boot
camp.)
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Download the installer that matches your operating
system and save it in your home folder.
</li>
<li>
Open a terminal window.
</li>
<li>
Type <pre>bash Anaconda-</pre> and then press
tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should
appear.
</li>
<li>
Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts. When
there is a colon at the bottom of the screen press the down
arrow to move down through the text. Type <code>yes</code> and
press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the
default location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
press enter to prepend Anaconda to your <code>PATH</code>
(this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).
</li>
</ol>
